---
--- `ts_ls`, aka `typescript-language-server`, is a Language Server Protocol implementation for TypeScript wrapping `tsserver`. Note that `ts_ls` is not `tsserver`.
---
--- `typescript-language-server` depends on `typescript`. Both packages can be installed via `npm`:
--- ```sh
--- npm install -g typescript typescript-language-server
--- ```
---
--- To configure typescript language server, add a
--- [`tsconfig.json`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) or
--- [`jsconfig.json`](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig) to the root of your
--- project.
---
--- Here's an example that disables type checking in JavaScript files.
---
--- ```json
--- {
---   "compilerOptions": {
---     "module": "commonjs",
---     "target": "es6",
---     "checkJs": false
---   },
---   "exclude": [
---     "node_modules"
---   ]
--- }
--- ```
---
--- Use the `:LspTypescriptSourceAction` command to see "whole file" ("source") code-actions such as:
--- - organize imports
--- - remove unused code
---
--- Use the `:LspTypescriptGoToSourceDefinition` command to navigate to the source definition of a symbol (e.g., jump to the original implementation instead of type definitions).
---
--- ### Monorepo support
---
--- `ts_ls` supports monorepos by default. It will automatically find the `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` corresponding to the package you are working on.
--- This works without the need of spawning multiple instances of `ts_ls`, saving memory.
---
--- It is recommended to use the same version of TypeScript in all packages, and therefore have it available in your workspace root. The location of the TypeScript binary will be determined automatically, but only once.
